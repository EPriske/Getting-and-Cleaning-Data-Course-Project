The file run_analysis.R will download, load the datasets, clean and tidy up the data and save the prepared data in a Text file 
called TidyData.txt. 
We follow the 5 instructions given to us in the "Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project".

1)Loading required libraries for cleaning and managing the data and Downloading the data. First we check if we have the file -
  already in our working directory. If not we download it. 
  We create 8 different Tables called:
    -features (561 obs of 2 variables)
    -activities (6 obs. of 2 variables)
    -subject_test (2947 obs. of 1 variables)
    -x_test (2947 obs. of 561 variables)
    -y_test (2947 obs. of 561 variables)
    -subject_train (7352 obs. of 1 variables)
    -x_train (7352 obs. of 561 variables)
    -y_train (7352 obs. of 1 variables)    
  
  Then Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  Merged from subject, y, x. In that respective order the M stands for Merged.
    -MSubject (10299 obs. of 1 variable)
    -MY (10299 obs. of 1 variable)
    -MX (10299 obs. of 561 variable)
    -MData (10299 obs. of 563 variable)
  
2)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  We use the select() function together with regular expressions. This was saved into MData2.
    -MData2 (10299 obs. of 88 variable)
 
3)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
   Here we merge the data from activities to change the numbers to their respective activity. MData3
    -MData3 (10299 obs. of 88 variable)
    
4)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  Here we use the function gsub() together with Regular expressions -
  to find out the labels in the columns and rename them with Descriptive -
  variable names. MData4
    -MData4 (10299 obs. of 88 variable)
    -code column in MData4 renamed into activities
    -All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
    -All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
    -All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
    -All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
    -All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
    -All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

5)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
  with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  Here we use the functions group_by() and summarize_all().
    -MData5 (180 obs. of 88 variable)
    -TidyData.txt
